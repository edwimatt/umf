            <p>Healthcare facilities are extremely complex, costly to operate, heavily regulated. They contain
                multiple utility systems that provide safety and the required environment of care for all patients,
                visitors and associates. Unfortunately, most healthcare associates lack the necessary understanding
                of these critical systems which put your facility at a higher risk of: non-compliance, increasing your
                operating budget and decreasing your patient, associates and visitorâ€™s safety and satisfaction.

                to enhance the knowledge of all healthcare associates. With the use of our unique and innovated
